# CHANGELOG

## 2.0.0

Initial release

## 2.1.0

* Added `labelProp` and `valueProp` properties (default to `label` and `value`)
  respectively) that allows the input structure to have different property names
  (like `name` and `id`, for instance)

* Added support for the `nodes` property to be in object format (i.e. keyed,
  non-array). In this case, the keys are currently simply ignored.
